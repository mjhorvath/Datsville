This program searches a JSON file generated by mpd2json or jsonflat for the 
search terms specified in a second JSON file, and outputs the results to a 
third JSON file. Note that all three JSON files have different formats and 
structures. This tool returns both partial and complete matches. The search 
terms may be strings or regular expressions. The output file name is the 
same as the input file name plus the ".result.json" extension.

To do: give the user the option to choose which field to search against.

cscript jsonsearch.js -j [JSON input path] -m [JSON input path]

-j [JSON input path] the JSON file to search in.
-m [JSON input path] the JSON file containing the search terms.
