This program reads an XMPD or MPD model and ouputs a JSON representation of 
the model. It ignores all line types except line type 1 and a few recognized 
meta commands. You should not expect the conversion process to be reversible 
for these reasons. The program also will NOT search the file system looking 
for sub-model files. This is why only the XMPD and MPD model formats are 
currently supported. XMPD models are generated by MPDCenter by Michael 
Heidemann. You will need to use an external utility to pretty-print the JSON 
file. There are several JSON pretty-printers available online. The output 
file name is the same as the input file name plus the ".json" extension.

cscript mpd2json.js [input path]

[input path] must be an XMPD file.
