NOTES

* Open the "wrapper" files and render them. The other files are included inside 
  the wrappers when needed.
* Note that the default L3P colors have not been updated to the latest values 
  listed in "ldconfig.ldr". They probably will never be as the author is no 
  longer active.
* Cannot use LDX (LDView) colors with (how many?) other scripts since it does 
  not separate textures and materials into separate entities like the other 
  tools do.
* Every material needs to have an IOR for SSLT to work. Further, ideally, the 
  IORs (and other materials properties) for ABS and PC plastics should be 
  different.
* Currently, SSLT only works with "materials_ldc_defs_mjh.inc" and 
  "materials_ldc_defs_clipka.inc".
* SSLT is super slow! Only enable it if you have a lot of time available to 
  dedicate to a render.
