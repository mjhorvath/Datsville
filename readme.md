## Introduction

Datsville is a LEGO-inspired city started in 1999 by users of LUGNET using the LDraw suite of CAD software. The goal of this project is to re-license models using a modern, open license, as well as to actively manage old and new submissions.


## Details

Since this project is brand new, the main things that need to be done at this moment are:

* Get permission to relicense models from the original model authors.
* Determine what (if any) organizational steps need to be taken to get models in a state where they are ready to render into new scenes, animations and so forth.

Once that is completed hopefully we can develop some ready-to-use tools for people to develop the scenes they want.

The preferred licenses are:

* [LGPL 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html) or later for programming code (POV-Ray SDL, JavaScript, etc.)
* [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode) or later  for artistic content (LDraw models, rendered images, etc.)

New submissions are of course always welcome! :)
